Hey, let me walk you through my awesome portfolio website and explain what it includes! First off, I want to showcase all the things I can do, so my website features a diverse range of skills and services that I offer.

To create a consistent and visually appealing look, I've incorporated my company's theme colors throughout the website. These three main colors are an integral part of my brand identity and add a touch of professionalism to the overall design.

Now, here's the exciting part! I've used JavaScript (JS) to add some interactive elements and enhance the user experience. One of the key highlights is that my website is designed to be suitable for all kinds of screen sizes. So whether you're browsing on a desktop, laptop, tablet, or mobile phone, the website will adapt and look great on your device.

But wait, there's more! I've added an additional function that adds value to visitors. If someone fills out the contact form on my website, all the details they provide will be securely recorded on a Google Sheet. This way, I can easily keep track of inquiries and follow up with potential clients promptly. It's a convenient and efficient way to manage communication and ensure I never miss an important message.
